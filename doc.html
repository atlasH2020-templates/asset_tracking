<h2>The "asset_tracking" ATLAS Service Template</h2>
<div style="margin-left: -22px;">
Abstract

This document describes the specifications for the asset_tracking service template whose purpose is to track movements and environmental measurements of assets.
</div>
<h2>1 Introduction</h2>

The asset_tracking service template is designed to provide necessary APIs to track and trace shipments.

<h2>2 Terminology</h2>

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

The notation "[xxx]" (xxx in square brackets) is equivalent to "array of xxx".

When used alone, the term "asset_tracking" refers to "asset_tracking ATLAS Service Template". Instead, "asset_tracking service" is equivalent to "an ATLAS Service implementing the asset_tracking ATLAS Service Template".

<h2>3 Pre-requisites</h2>

A thorough understanding in the following is required for
both service consumers or service provider implementors:
<pre>
    - World Geodetic Coordinate Reference System (WGS84) 
      (<a href="https://gisgeography.com/wgs84-world-geodetic-system/">https://gisgeography.com/wgs84-world-geodetic-system/</a>) 
    - ISO8601 representation of dates and times
      (<a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html">https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html</a>)
</pre>
<h2>4 asset_tracking Sample Usage Scenarios</h2>

The following are some examples of how the asset_tracking service can be used:
<h3>4.1 Product Monitoring</h3>
The "asset_tracking" service template can provide real-time temperature and humidity data for a product shipped using a pallet. In this case, the service can be used to see if products are in a good environment in terms of temperature and humidity.

<h3>4.2 Tracking livestock transports</h3>
The "asset_tracking" service template can provide information about planned livestock shipments to a slaughterhouse as well as live information about transport status, such as the current location and/or the estimated time of arrival.

In such a scenario, the slaughterhouse typically plans shipments on their proprietary system, based on contractual agreements with farmers. By implementing the asset_tracking service template and enabling farmers to access shipments for which they are the suppliers, the slaughterhouse system enables the farmer to pair his livestock management with his farmer access on the slaughterhouse's asset_tracking system and visualize from this central location the upcoming shipments that are planned as well as the transport status of shipments in transit.

<h2>5 Service Template Structure</h2>
Here the purpose of each API in the service template will be discussed.

<h3>5.1 list_shipments</h3>
The <i>list_shipments</i> endpoint is used to retrieve information about shipments that are planned or in progress.

<pre>
+----------------------------------------------------+
| list_shipments                                     |
+-------------+--------------------------------------+
|      Inputs | List shipments,                      |
|             | filtering parameters                 |
+-------------+--------------------------------------+
|     Outputs | [shipment ID,descr,status,date]      |
+-------------+--------------------------------------+
</pre>

<h3>5.2 get_shipment_info</h3>
The <i>get_shipment_info</i> endpoint is used to retrieve detailed information about a shipment.

<pre>
+----------------------------------------------------+
| get_shipment_info                                  |
+-------------+--------------------------------------+
|      Inputs | shipment ID                          |
+-------------+--------------------------------------+
|     Outputs | dessc, dates, locations, manifest    |
+-------------+--------------------------------------+
</pre>

The shipment's details format will vary based on the shipment type. Please refer to the OpenAPI specifications.

<h3>5.3 track_shipment</h3>
The <i>track_shipment</i> endpoint provides estimated arrival time and environmental information (e.g. temperature, humidity, ... when available) for a shipment whose status is 'in_transit'.

The request may include filtering attributes such as time ranges.

<pre>
+------------------------------------------------+
| track_shipment                                 |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
|      Inputs | shipment ID,filtering parameters |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
|     Outputs | Tracking data points             |
+-------------+----------------------------------+
</pre>

Service must ensure that there are no duplicate tracking data entries. There must be no two tracking data points with the same location, and measurements within the same response.

There are some cases in which there is no tracking data available. For example, in the specified time range, there was no tracking information for the asset based on the filtering criteria or parameters. In this case, the response will still be valid but with an empty list ([]) for data.

Please refer to the OpenAPI specification for details about data schemas and formats returned by the <i>track_shipment</i> endpoint, as well as to ANNEX 1 for a list of normalized environmental measurements that may be offered by asset_tracking services.

<h2>ANNEX 1 - Environmental Measurement Types</h2>

This is a list of standardized measurement parameters that asset_tracking services must comply with. Newer versions of the asset_tracking template are likely to extend this list. Additional proprietary measurements may be included by some services.
